//===================================================================
// FPS.cs
// 
// This file provides functions to keep track of the current and
// average number of Frames Per Second being achieved by the application.
//
// How To Use:
//  You do not need to create an instance of the FPS class since it
//  is a static class. Just call the Update() function every frame
//  (so likely from within the Draw() function), and check the
//  CurrentFPS and/or AverageFPS properties to read the Frames Per Second.
